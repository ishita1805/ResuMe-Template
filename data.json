    "about": "You are smart, ambitious and passionate about scaling your Cloud Consulting business. The question is, do you go alone or get some help?Here is my story to see if I can help. At age 18 I was diagnosed with a condition called Polycystic kidney disease (PKD). A condition that plagued my family. Knowing what was to come, I made the most out of it. Always learning and helping others. I started at Coca-Cola and over 18 years, I led large sales teams, transformed billion-dollar business units and led global partnerships. In 2011 the demands of Corporate Directorship forced my hand. I have been on the entrepreneurial journey ever since, taking what I learnt at Coca-Cola - the power of the brand owner and the nimbleness of franschiees. In a way, the Cloud Industry is a better version of the \u201cCoke Way\u2019. I created two Cloud Consultancy businesses - one that didn\u2019t work and one that did.Tapping into my Coke experience and learnings, I was able to create a successful exit by focusing on\u2705 Niche markets\u2705 Right business model\u2705 Predictable Sales Machine\u2705 Strategic referral partnerships\u2705 High performing teamAnd you can do this too!

Not everyone is going to build a global unicorn and that is okay.\"\n\nNathan Chan, CEO of Foundr magazine\n\n\"I speak five languages and love helping entrepreneurs to build lasting relationships which open doors they can only dream of opening. But the language of small business was very foreign to me when I escaped my corporate lawyer's role.\nPaul Higgins helps solopreneurs to understand the language of small business so they can leverage their strengths to impact more people in the world.\"\n\nJordan Harbinger, Critically acclaimed host of The Jordan Harbinger Show\n\n\"I admire people who speak from actual experience, instead of just theory. Paul is one of those rare thought leaders who follow this rule. His corporate background, his eventual departure, and the life he has been able to build, for himself and others since is a testament to his expertise and heart.\"\u2028\n\nAri Meisel, Founder of Less Doing\n\n\"Paul shares a great story about his transition from being an employee to becoming an Entrepreneur. Remarkably, he has achieved all this whilst living with a major health condition. Inspiring stuff.
